###
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

palindromic = (n) ->
  a = n.toString()

  for i in [0..Math.floor(a.length / 2) - 1]
    if a.charAt(i) != a.charAt(a.length - 1 - i)
      return false

  true

max = 0
for i in [100..999]
  for j in [100..999]
    n = i * j
    if palindromic(n) and n > max
      max = n

console.log max
